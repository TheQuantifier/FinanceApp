🏠 Home (Dashboard Overview)
Goal: Give a snapshot of the user’s finances — not all the details.
✅ Keep these:
Welcome message → “Welcome back, [Name]”
Two or three summary cards:
Total Income
Total Expenses
Net Balance or Spending This Month
Quick links:
“Upload a Receipt” → opens Upload page
“View Reports” → opens Reports page
🚫 Remove from Home:
Recent receipts table (move to Records)
Spending by category (move to Reports)
This keeps Home clean and fast — a snapshot + entry point.

📤 Upload
Goal: Handle uploading and OCR scanning.
✅ Keep everything here (upload modal, OCR, etc.) — this is a functional page.
📜 Records
Goal: Be the main data table.
✅ Display full list of receipts, edit/delete, and export.
No summary stats here — just detailed history.

📈 Reports
Goal: Visualization + insights.
✅ Show spending trends, charts, and optional AI summary.
This page should feel analytical — where users see patterns.

ℹ️ About
Goal: Brand + story of the app (simple content page).
So the page balance becomes:
Home = Summary
Upload = Action
Records = Data
Reports = Insights
About = Context
